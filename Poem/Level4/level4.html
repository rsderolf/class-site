    <h1>Whatif</h1>

    <p>Last night, while I lay thinking here,<br>
  Some Whatifs crawled inside my ear<br>
  And pranced and partied all night long<br>
  And sang their same old Whatif song:<br><br>
  Whatif I'm dumb in school?<br>
  Whatif they've closed the swimming pool?<br>
  Whatif I get beat up?<br>
  Whatif there's poison in my cup?<br>
  Whatif I start to cry?<br>
  Whatif I get sick and die?<br>
  Whatif I flunk that test?<br>
  Whatif green hair grows on my chest?<br>
  Whatif nobody likes me?<br>
  Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?<br>
  Whatif I don't grow taller?<br>
  Whatif my head starts getting smaller?<br>
  Whatif the fish won't bite?<br>
  Whatif the wind tears up my kite?<br>
  Whatif they start a war?<br>
  Whatif my parents get divorced?<br>
  Whatif the bus is late?<br>
  Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight?<br>
  Whatif I tear my pants?<br>
  Whatif I never learn to dance?<br><br>
  Everything seems swell, and then<br>
  The nighttime Whatifs strike again!</p>
