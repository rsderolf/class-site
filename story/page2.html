      <p>Tantalus was the king of Sipylus, known for his great wealth. His father was Zeus and his mother the nymph Pluto, making him just a mortal. He was given the privilege of dining with the gods in Mt. Olympus, where he misbehaved
        spectacularly. Tantalus stole some of the divine nectar and ambrosia served at dinner, so that the mortals below may become immortal. <br><br> Drag and drop the nectar and ambrosia into Tantalus' bag.</p>
